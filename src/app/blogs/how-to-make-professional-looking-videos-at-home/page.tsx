            </p>

            <h3>1. Setting Up Your Home Studio</h3>
            <p>
              A professional video starts with a well-prepared environment. You don‚Äôt need a green screen or expensive lights‚ÄîScenith‚Äôs tools can enhance what you already have. Begin by choosing a quiet room with neutral walls, then use natural light or affordable ring lights to illuminate your face evenly.

            <ol className={styles.stepList}>
              <li>
                <strong>Choose a Location:</strong> Select a quiet corner with minimal distractions and good natural light.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set Up Lighting:</strong> Use a $20 ring light or position yourself facing a window, adjusting with Scenith‚Äôs exposure tools.

              <li>
                <strong>Record in a Quiet Space:</strong> Minimize echo by adding soft furnishings or using Scenith‚Äôs noise reduction.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Edit Audio:</strong> Balance voice and music in Scenith‚Äôs multi-track editor for a polished sound.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Advanced Tip: Test your audio setup with a short clip in Scenith to ensure clarity before recording the full video.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Editing with Scenith</h3>

            <p>
              Manual home video setup involves using physical equipment and traditional editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve. This method requires investing in lights, microphones, and a computer with robust specs, offering full control but demanding time and technical knowledge. It‚Äôs suited for creators willing to build a dedicated home studio.
            </p>

            <h3>Popular Manual Options:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ring Lights and Softboxes:</strong> Invest in $50-$100 lighting kits for even illumination.</li>
              <li><strong>Adobe Premiere Pro:</strong> Use for manual editing, requiring a powerful laptop and expertise.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>General Workflow:</h3>
            <ol className={styles.stepList}>
              <li><strong>Setup Equipment:</strong> Arrange lights, mic, and camera in a quiet room.
              </li>

              </li>
              <li><strong>Edit Manually:</strong> Use software to cut, color grade, and export in HD.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Test Output:</strong> Review on different devices to ensure quality.</li>
            </ol>
